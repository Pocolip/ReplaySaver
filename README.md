## Installation

## How It Works

2. **Battle End Recognition**: When a battle ends (win, loss, forfeit, tie), it's automatically detected (relies on the chat so keep your battle open!)
3. **Replay Generation**: The extension sends the `/savereplay` command to Pokemon Showdown
4. **Link Extraction**: It constructs the replay URL and saves it locally
5. **Storage**: All replay data is stored in your browser's local storage
